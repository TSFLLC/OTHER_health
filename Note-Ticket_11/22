Implemented a Proof of Concept (POC) for the new Static Data Tokenization Framework to protect sensitive PII/PHI data in non-production environments while maintaining usability for application testing, BI development, and integration workflows.

The solution includes a secure, deterministic, format-preserving tokenization process that allows for controlled reversal by designated administrators only.


Scope of Work (Short Version)

Created Tokenization Infrastructure

Added new schema Tokenization in Ardent_DBA_Utilities.

Created secure mapping table Tokenization.Tokeng_Map with unique index and restricted access.

Implemented Deterministic Tokenization Function

Built fn_FormatPreservingToken to generate format-preserving, repeatable tokens for all string-based PII fields.

Developed Set-Based Tokenization Procedure in TERA

Added usp_TokenizeColumn_SetBased for efficient, bulk tokenization using deterministic logic and unique key matching.

Added Controlled Reversal Procedure

Implemented usp_DeTokenizeColumn for authorized admin-only reversal of tokenized data.

Enforced Security Model

Created TokenizationAdmin role with exclusive access to mapping table.

Denied all mapping-table access to non-admins; granted EXECUTE-only permissions for tokenization routines.

Validated Tokenization End-to-End

Successfully tokenized and reversed key PII columns including Email, Phone, SSN, Names, and Address fields.
